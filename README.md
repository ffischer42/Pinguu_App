# pinguu_app

This app will be an UI for https://pinguu.tech
Within this App, you'll be able to monitor and control your crypto bots live. As this app is in a very early stage, this project will change quite often.

## Getting Started

In order to use my crypto bot (Pinguu) you'll need an account for Binance.com. You have that? Then apply for a beta-tester account by mail: info@felixfischer.io
The Pinguu bot is running since December 2020 and I'm working constantly on improvements and bug fixes.
